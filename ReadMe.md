## üé¨ About the project
<p align="justify"> 
  All the major news site are based on the format of display all the headlines of the day, with advertisement poping on the side. which is fully of distractions; Sometimes, it's really hard to find the article or the headline you've seen on the subway but lost the internet. That's how the TinNews got its inspiration. It provides a new ways for user to find their favorite news of the day with the limited time! It is a News version of Tinder that with pre-selected news per batch, displayed as cardStackView with headlines, image and breif intros, users can simply swipe left and right to discard or save the news for later read. The app also supports users to search news by keyword. What if with the art of swiping What if we have a more curaion and help filter the contents before display to our users?

## :fire: Key Features

<p align="justify"> 
  For those of you not familiar with Pacman, it's a game where Pacman (the yellow circle with a mouth in the above figure) moves around in a maze and tries to eat as many food pellets (the small white dots) as possible, while avoiding the ghosts (the other two agents with eyes in the above figure). If Pacman eats all the food in a maze, it wins.
